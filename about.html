<h1><u>About Page</u></h1>
<p>Specialty stores are <b>retail businesses</b> that focus on "specific <a href="www.product categories.com">product categories</a>, such as office supplies, men's or women's clothing, or carpet. It isn't the product they sell that determines if a company is a <u>specialty store</u>, but rather the breadth of their product offering. If a company could be considered an expert in a certain type of good, it is a specialty store.
A specialty store is a shop, usually <b>retail</b>, that offers specific and specialized <a href="types of items">types of items</a>. These stores focus on selling a particular brand or a particular type of product. For example, a store that exclusively sells <u>cell phones</u> or <u>video games</u> would be considered specialized.
The definition for specialty store is actually somewhat loose. Sometimes, it includes <b>chain retail stores</b> that sell a specific brand of clothing or clothing that is manufactured specifically for that store. If a shopper buys a shirt from the Gap, for example, it will have a <a href="www.Gap label.com">Gap Label</a>.
By this definition, the store can carry a diverse range of products. Though a store might specialize in clothing, the garments could be for <u>children</u>, <u>teens</u>, or <u>adults</u>. It might also carry shoes or socks. Some places branch out even more, carrying clothes for the whole family, as well as accessories, dog bowls, toys, and a variety of other <b>non-clothing related items</b>, all with the store label.
Farmers who grow organic produce often sell to specialty markets and health food stores.
In other cases, the specialty store is not brand sensitive, but offers certain kinds of items that could all be loosely classed together. A <u>grocery store</u> that specializes in selling organic products, for example, would be considered a specialty retailer. The many ethnic foods markets that import most of their products are also examples. The products they carry can vary significantly, but they all fall under the class of being imported from a specific place like Asia, England, or Italy.
Many upscale boutiques specialize in trendy couture for women.
Another example is a store that sells one kind of item only, like cell phones or video games. The <a href="www.product selection.com">product selection</a> is usually wide at a store that sells video games, and it is likely to have products that work with a variety of game systems. A <b>cell phone store</b> might sell many different cell phone brands, in addition to offering access to contracts with a specific cell phone company.
Specialty stores may set up a storefront for a limited time in a shopping mall.
Some specialty stores are not linked to a <a href="www.chain of stores.com">chain of stores</a>, but operate from a single location. A small health food store, a high-class womenâ€™s boutique that offers <u>couture clothing</u>, or a <u>little bait</u> and <u>tackle sho</u> may all be considered examples of such a store. Even though prices might be higher at these establishments, customers often prefer the expertise offered by small stores, which are often opened by owners who are passionate about the products they sell. In <b>large chain stores</b>, employees may not offer the same assistance and product knowledge. There are exceptions, of course, and some chain stores are known for their <a href="high degree of customer service">high degree of customer service and <a href="product knowledge">product knowledge</a></p>
