<p>Specialty stores are <b>retail businesses</b> that focus on <br>"specific <a href="www.product categories.com">product categories</a>, such as office supplies<br>, men's or women's clothing, or carpet. It isn't the <br>product they sell that determines if a company is a <br><u>specialty store</u>, but rather the breadth of their <br>product offering. If a company could be considered an <br>expert in a certain type of good, it is a specialty store.
<br>A specialty store is a shop, usually <b>retail</b>, that offers <br>specific and specialized <a href="types of items">types of items</a>. These stores <br>focus on selling a particular brand or a particular <br>type of product. For example, a store that exclusively <br>sells <u>cell phones</u> or <u>video games</u> would be <br>considered specialized.
The definition for specialty <br>store is actually somewhat loose. Sometimes, it <br>includes <b>chain retail stores.</b></p>
